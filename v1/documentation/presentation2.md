# American Car Club Website Project Charter

## 1. Project Objectives

### Purpose:
To create a centralized digital platform that unifies fragmented communication channels for car club members, enhancing community engagement and simplifying event organization.

### Objectives:
1. Develop a unified membership system that streamlines the registration and approval process, replacing current fragmented approaches (Facebook, email, phone calls).
2. Implement an intuitive event management system that allows members to discover, track, and participate in club activities.
3. Create a dedicated space for members to showcase their vehicles and connect with other enthusiasts through customizable profiles.

## 2. Stakeholders and Team Roles

### Stakeholders:
**Internal:**
- Development Team (currently a solo student developer)
- Holberton School (academic oversight)

**External:**
- Car club members (primary users)
- Car club leadership (administrators)
- Car enthusiasts without American cars (secondary users)

### Team Roles:
| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|-----------------|
| Project Manager | Overall project planning, timeline management, and resource allocation |
| Developer | Implementation of backend and frontend systems, database design |
| Designer | User interface design, user experience flows, visual identity |
| QA Tester | Testing functionality, identifying bugs, verifying user flows |

*Note: As a solo developer, I'm currently fulfilling all these roles but have defined them separately for clear accountability and future potential team expansion.*

## 3. Define Scope

### In-Scope:
- User authentication system with admin approval workflow
- Member profiles with car details and role assignments
- Member directory with search and filter capabilities
- Event calendar with basic RSVP functionality
- Admin dashboard for membership approval and basic moderation
- Mobile-responsive design for all core features

### Out-of-Scope:
- Forum/discussion system
- Marketplace for parts/cars
- Photo galleries beyond basic profile images
- Member-to-member messaging
- Email notifications (planned for future phases)
- Advanced analytics reporting
- Third-party integrations (social media, payment processors)

## 4. Identify Risks

| Risk | Severity | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|----------|------------|---------------------|
| Time management conflicts with school commitments | High | High | Establish strict scheduling with buffer periods, prioritize MVP features |
| Technical complexity of user approval flow | Medium | Medium | Research existing implementation patterns, develop simple version first before enhancing |
| Limited experience with React's advanced features | Medium | High | Allocate time for learning and experimentation, use simpler approaches where possible |
| Server configuration and deployment issues | Medium | Medium | Use managed hosting solutions initially, document all configuration steps |
| Feature creep extending development timeline | High | Medium | Regularly review scope against objectives, maintain strict prioritization |
