### Slide Text:
Hello everyone, I'm Jayson Pasquier, C25, and today I'm going to talk about a website called American Muscle Car France or AMCF.

But before that, I'm going to talk a little about myself. So I always used computers and consoles in general since I'm a child and I always wanted to work in video game programming, and when I heard that Holberton School exists I was so happy because I was finally going to be able to work and learn something that I like so it was a great opportunity for me.

This project represents both a technical challenge and a personal mission to help my family build their dream community.

  - WhatsApp groups (messy for events)

**Community Challenges:**
- Difficult to maintain member directories
- Event organization is chaotic
- No quality control for new members
- Hard to showcase member vehicles
- No centralized knowledge sharing

## Slide 6: Technical Architecture

### Modern, Scalable Web Stack

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Frontend      │    │     Backend      │    │    Database     │

│ • Responsive    │    │ • Django Admin   │    │ • Media Files   │
└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

**Technology Choices & Justifications:**

**Backend - Django Framework:**
- **Rapid Development:** Built-in admin interface saved weeks of development
- **Security First:** Built-in protection against common vulnerabilities
- **ORM Power:** Complex database relationships made simple
- **Community Support:** Extensive documentation and third-party packages

**Frontend - Server-Side Rendering:**
- **SEO Optimized:** Better search engine visibility for the club
- **Fast Loading:** Server-rendered pages load quickly on all devices
- **Mobile First:** Responsive design works on phones, tablets, and desktops

**Database - SQLite (Development) → PostgreSQL (Production):**
- **Development Speed:** SQLite for rapid local development
- **Production Ready:** PostgreSQL planned for scaling

## Slide 7: Database Design & Models

### Structured Data Architecture

**Core Models:**

```python
User (Django Auth)
├── UserProfile (1:1)
│   ├── member_id (auto-generated)
│   ├── role (founder/co-founder/member/developer/admin)
│   ├── profile_image, social_links
│   └── approval_status
│
├── Events (1:Many)
│   ├── event_details, location
│   ├── RSVP system
│   └── flyer attachments
│
├── Posts (1:Many) - Social Features
│   ├── images/videos
│   └── admin approval required
│
└── Forum Topics & Replies (Future)
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Sequential Member IDs:** Professional membership tracking (#001, #002, etc.)
- **Role-Based Permissions:** Different access levels for founders vs members
- **Approval Workflows:** All content moderated before public display
- **Media Management:** Local file storage with organized folder structure

---

## Slide 8: Key Features Deep Dive

- **Social Integration:** Instagram, Facebook, Twitter links
- **Activity Tracking:** Join date, last login

**Directory Benefits:**
- **Searchable by car type, member name, or role**
- **Visual grid layout showcasing member vehicles**
- **Mobile-optimized for browsing on the go**

### 3. Event Management System

**Organizer Tools:**
- Create events with date, time, location
- Upload front/back event flyers
- Track RSVP responses
- Manage event publication

**Member Experience:**

## Slide 13: Technical Demonstration

### Code Quality & Best Practices

**Django Admin Customization:**
```python
@admin.register(UserProfile)
class UserProfileAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ('member_id', 'user', 'role', 'is_approved', 'date_created')
    list_filter = ('role', 'is_approved', 'date_created')
    search_fields = ('user__username', 'user__first_name', 'user__last_name')
    actions = ['approve_members', 'reject_members']
```

**Model Design Pattern:**
```python
class Event(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200, verbose_name="Titre")
    event_date = models.DateTimeField(verbose_name="Date de l'événement")
    is_published = models.BooleanField(default=False)

    def get_participants_count(self):
        return self.participants.count()

    def is_user_participating(self, user):
        return self.participants.filter(user=user).exists()
```

**Security Considerations:**
- CSRF protection on all forms
- User authentication required for sensitive actions
- File upload validation and type checking
- SQL injection protection through Django ORM
